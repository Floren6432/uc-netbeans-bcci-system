This repository contains a Java Swing application that was developed during my second year at university. It calculates employee deductions including Income Tax, SSS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth contributions based on monthly salary input. The program applies government rates and brackets to provide accurate deduction amounts through a simple graphical user interface.
